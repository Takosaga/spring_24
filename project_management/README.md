# Article Management System Project: Agile Development Report

This project report details the development of a custom article management system using an Agile (Scrum) approach. The system aims to address the inefficiencies of email-based review processes for academic journals.

## Project Overview

This project tackles the challenges faced by academic journals relying on email for manuscript submissions and reviews. The proposed solution is a custom article management system designed to streamline workflows, improve transparency, enhance security, and scale effectively.

## Key Project Phases

*   **Phase 1: Product Inception and Business Requirements**
    *   **Problem Analysis:** Identifies the limitations of email-based review processes, including delays, lack of transparency, security risks, and scalability issues.
    *   **Business Requirements:** Defines the core features of the article management system:
        *   User Management (registration, login, profiles)
        *   Submissions (online platform, file uploads)
        *   Review Process (reviewer assignment, communication)
        *   Searchable Database
        *   Notifications (email/in-system)

*   **Phase 2: Project Initiation**
    *   **Business Case:** Presents a business case to "Strategic Solutions Group" for project approval and resources for "Scholar Stream," a new journal.
    *   **Project Charter:** Outlines project background, goals, scope, key stakeholders (client, sponsor, project manager, development team), milestones, budget, constraints, assumptions, risks, and dependencies. Scrum framework is adopted with two-week sprints.

*   **Phase 3: Defining Product Scope**
    *   **Stakeholder List:** Identifies key stakeholders and their roles.
    *   **Product Requirements:** Defines functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., user roles, system design, security, availability, interface layout).

*   **Phase 4: Project Planning**
    *   **Scope Planning:** Develops a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS dictionary.
    *   **Product Backlog:** Creates a product backlog with user stories based on the WBS. Example user stories related to initial content review, plagiarism checks, and subject matter expert reviews are included.
    *   **Project Schedule:** Creates a project schedule with story points, a Gantt chart, and a sprint example. Planning poker is used for story point estimation.
    *   **Product Quality Management (PQM):** Defines QA (quality assurance) and QC (quality control) processes, including reviews, testing (unit, integration, system, UAT), and the Definition of Done (DoD).
    *   **Project Risk Management:** Performs risk analysis for a sample user story, including risk identification, probability/impact assessment, and mitigation strategies.
    *   **Project Cost Management:** Provides a bottom-up cost estimate based on story points and team size. Includes contingency reserves and rough order of magnitude estimates.
    *   **Communication Management:** Defines communication methods and types for different stakeholders.
    *   **Project Stakeholder Management:** Creates a stakeholder register and stakeholder analysis matrix.

*   **Phase 5: Defining Requirements Management, Project Control, and Monitoring Strategies**
    *   **Requirements Management:** Explains the importance of requirements management and uses a RACI matrix to define roles and responsibilities.
    *   **Project Control and Monitoring:** Introduces SPI (Schedule Performance Index) and CPI (Cost Performance Index) as key metrics, along with release burndown charts, to track project progress and identify potential issues.

## Conclusion
